gbsh

This is a custom shell made for Linux based systems. It can accomplish most things the standard bash shell is able to, and is easily modifiable for additional functionality.

Launch shell by running chmod +x launch-shell.sh and ./launch-shell.sh, or just bash launch-shell.sh. It can also be compiled and launched as a standard C++ program, but using it this way may resut in certain missing features and safeguards.
